# Traffic Sign Recognition System

## Project Overview
A comprehensive machine learning project for traffic sign recognition and classification using deep learning techniques. This system aims to accurately identify and classify traffic signs from images to support autonomous driving and driver assistance systems.

## Current Progress

### ✅ Completed Components

#### 1. Project Structure & Setup
- **Established modular project architecture** with dedicated directories for data, source code, and notebooks
- **Environment configuration** with requirements.txt for dependency management
- **Git repository initialization** with proper .gitignore configuration to exclude large data files

#### 2. Data Infrastructure
- **Data loading framework** implemented in `src/data/data_loader.py`
- **Modular data package** structure with `src/data/__init__.py`
- **Dataset organization** with Train.csv, Test.csv, and Meta.csv files properly structured

#### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Comprehensive EDA notebook** created in `src/notebooks/exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`
- **Data visualization and statistical analysis** framework established

#### 4. Development Environment
- **Python-based development stack** configured
- **Jupyter notebook integration** for interactive development
- **Professional codebase structure** following Python best practices

## Technical Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (planned)
- **Development**: Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code
